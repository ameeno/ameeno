### _Architecting resilient platforms, built on a foundation of SRE and DevOps excellence._

---

As a Principal Platform Engineer, I operate at the intersection of platform architecture, Site Reliability Engineering, and hands-on software development. I don't just design the "paved road"; I build it, secure it, and ensure it's resilient enough to handle anything thrown at it.

My approach blends strategic vision with deep technical implementation. With expert-level skills in **Python, Go, Bash, and HCL**, I transform architectural blueprints into robust, automated, and self-service developer platforms that are built to last.

## üèõÔ∏è My Guiding Principles

My work is guided by a fusion of platform, SRE, and DevOps philosophies:

1.  **Reliability is a Feature (The SRE Mindset)**
    -   Building systems that are observable, scalable, and self-healing by default.
    -   Applying SLOs/SLIs to the platform itself, ensuring it's a rock-solid foundation for all services.

2.  **Automate the Toil Away (The DevOps Culture)**
    -   Creating frictionless CI/CD, GitOps workflows, and automated governance.
    -   If it's manual and repeatable, it's a target for automation.

3.  **Code is the Foundation (The Builder's Craft)**
    -   Writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code to create the tools and services that power the platform.
    -   Treating infrastructure as a software engineering problem, not a configuration exercise.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Arsenal

A curated list of technologies I use to architect and build world-class platforms.

| Domain                     | Technologies & Languages                                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Platform & Automation**  | `Python` `Go` `Bash` `JavaScript`                                                                      |
| **Cloud & IaC**            | `AWS` `Azure` `Terraform (HCL)` `Spacelift` `Pulumi`                                                     |
| **Container Platform**     | `Kubernetes (K8s)` `Istio` `Helm` `Docker`                                                             |
