## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I'm a Senior SRE who believes that the best infrastructure is invisibleâ€”it just works. My focus is on automating complexity, ensuring systems are observable by default, and optimizing for both performance and cost.

I thrive on solving complex distributed systems problems, whether it's designing a multi-region Kubernetes strategy or scripting away the last piece of operational toil.

- **Currently:** Building and scaling cloud-native platforms.
- **Core Philosophy:** Automate everything, measure everything, and never stop learning.
- **Ask me about:** GitOps, cost optimization in AWS, or building a strong DevOps culture.
