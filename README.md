## Mission

As a Principal Platform Engineer, I operate at the intersection of platform architecture, Site Reliability Engineering, and hands-on software development. My mission is to build the "paved road"‚Äîa secure, scalable, and automated internal developer platform (IDP) that empowers engineering teams to ship software with velocity and confidence. I don't just design the systems; I write the code that brings them to life.

---

## Core Pillars

My work is centered around a fusion of three core principles:

1.  **üèõÔ∏è Architect & Builder**
    I design and construct the foundational infrastructure primitives (Kubernetes, IaC, Networking) and the cohesive toolchains (CI/CD, GitOps) that serve as the backbone of the engineering organization. My philosophy is to treat infrastructure as a software engineering problem, delivering clean, maintainable, and efficient code in **Go, Python, and Bash**.

2.  **üõ°Ô∏è Reliability as a Feature**
    With a deep background in SRE, I engineer systems that are observable, scalable, and self-healing by default. I apply SLOs/SLIs to the platform itself, ensuring it provides a rock-solid, highly-available foundation for all services.

3.  **üöÄ Developer Empowerment**
    My ultimate goal is to be a force multiplier. I reduce cognitive load for developers by creating frictionless, self-service workflows and powerful abstractions. By providing a world-class developer experience, I enable teams to focus on innovation, not on infrastructure.
