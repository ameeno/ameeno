## üëã Who I Am

I'm a Principal Platform Engineer who builds the tools that empower developers. My unique strength lies in blending high-level system design with a deep, SRE-driven focus on reliability and the coding expertise to build the solution from the ground up. I don't just talk about theory; I ship production-grade platform code.

---

## ‚ú® What I Bring to the Table

-   **üèõÔ∏è Platform Architecture:** Designing the "paved road" for developers, from CI/CD frameworks to self-service cloud infrastructure. I focus on creating systems that are intuitive, secure, and scalable.

-   **üõ°Ô∏è SRE & DevOps DNA:** Engineering reliability, observability, and automation into the core of the platform. I ensure that the systems we build are not just functional, but fundamentally resilient.

-   **üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Hands-On Implementation:** Writing high-quality code to bring the vision to life. My toolbox includes **Python, Go, Bash, HCL, and JavaScript** to build the custom controllers, automation scripts, and infrastructure modules that power a modern developer platform.
