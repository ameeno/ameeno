### _Engineering resilient infrastructure that scales, automates, and thrives under pressure._

---

I'm a Senior SRE with a passion for building self-healing, observable, and cost-efficient cloud-native systems. From architecting entire environments with Terraform to fine-tuning CI/CD pipelines for maximum velocity, I bring a steady hand to complex, mission-critical infrastructure.

- 🚀 **Infrastructure as Code:** Building immutable, repeatable environments.
- 📊 **Elite Performance:** Obsessed with uptime, latency, and observability.
- 🤖 **Automation First:** Eliminating toil to focus on what matters.
- ☁️ **Cloud Native:** Deep expertise in AWS, Azure, and Kubernetes ecosystems.
